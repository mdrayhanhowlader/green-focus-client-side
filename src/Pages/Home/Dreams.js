          It was a dream when i saw my father. His photography was so good. Now
          I am a photographer. I like to take wild photo, Beautiful nature,
          animals, specially deers. I like to take deer photos. they are so
          humble and friendly. I have a story of Sundarban forest with dear. If
          i get a time sometimes i will share with you. Thank you.
